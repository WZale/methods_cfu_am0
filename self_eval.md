# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
  * Today, I'm proud of my diligence. I am just coming up on 13 hours spent on assignments (with breaks and meals.) While I won't be able to complete everything that is due tonight, I know that I did work to the best of my ability, asked for help when I needed it, and helped others when I could. I'm sure I've made mistakes, but that simply means that I'm learning. I signed up for an intense experience, and I'm definitely getting it!

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
  * Methods are useful tools because, as pre-existing or custom-made packages of instructions, they allow us to manipulate data that contained in a variable. Methods can be used as many times as needed, so they simplify the various processes we ask of them and function as a kind of "machine" with different inputs and outputs. Methods make our lives easier, I think is the takeaway.
